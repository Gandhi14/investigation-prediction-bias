This repository contains the code and data for the analysis we carried out for our [investigation](https://themarkup.org/prediction-bias/2021/12/02/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-new-data-shows-it-perpetuates-them), which is described in detail in our [methodology](https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2021/12/02/how-we-determined-crime-prediction-software-disproportionately-targeted-low-income-black-and-latino-neighborhoods). It relies on the R package [Targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to generate a reproducible analysis pipeline.

For the sake of convenience, we've already committed the output from the pipeline to the repository. You will find it in the `out` folder. If you want to re-run the analysis and verify the steps yourself, follow the instructions in the Setup section of the Readme.

### Data

In this repository the data used as the input for analysis is stored in the `in` folder, and the dataframes, plots, and findings that are generated from the analysis are stored in the `out` folder. There is also a `datasheets` folder that contains a one-page summary of this analysis for each jurisdiction individually and the raw reports we obtained from PredPol's servers.

#### PredPol (now Geolitica) Reports

You can download the raw PredPol reports used as the basis of this analysis [here](https://markup-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/predictive-policing/raw-predictions.tar.xz).
Note: The addresses listed in the prediction reports are the center of the prediction box. The actual predictions encompass the entire box, not just the address marked at the center.

#### Datasheets folder

| Folder or Filename | Description                                                   |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `datasheet.Rmd`    | R Markdown that generates the datasheet                       |
| `geojson`          | Folder that contains GeoJSON that is used for generating maps |
| `html`             | Folder that contains HTML version of the datasheets           |
| `pdf`              | Folder that contains PDF version of the datasheets            |

### Setup

To run the analysis

- Install the following packages in RStudio using `install.packages`:
  - tidyverse
  - targets
  - glue
  - tarchetypes
  - leaflet
- Extract the contents of `in.tar.xz`.

### Run Analysis

- Run `library(targets)`
- Run `tar_make()`.

Once you folow the setup steps and run `tar_make()`, the entire pipeline will be run and all the analysis artifacts will be generated. The first time around this usually takes about 10 minutes.

If you are running this repository for the first time and have set it up correctly, there should be no difference between what is already in the `out` folder and what is generated after running `tar_make()`.

The `out` folder contains the latest output from the analysis already. If you re-run the pipeline after using `tar_make()` adding the `in` folder, nothing should change if you have the latest `in` folder and codebase.

### Data Sheets

Data sheets looking at each department in our analysis individually. These are also available in PDF form at `datasheets/pdfs`.
